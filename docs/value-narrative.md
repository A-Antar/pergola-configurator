# H2 Patios 3D Visual CPQ — Value Narrative

## What Is This?

A **3D Visual Configure-Price-Quote (CPQ) system** purpose-built for Australian outdoor living builders. It replaces static quote forms with an interactive 3D design experience that:

1. Lets homeowners configure their patio/carport in real-time 3D
2. Provides instant pricing estimates based on real Stratco product data
3. Captures qualified leads with full design data, screenshots, and estimates
4. Gives the business an admin portal to manage pricing, leads, and analytics

## Why It's Worth $25,000–$80,000

### Engineering Value ($15k–$30k)
- **Parametric 3D engine** with real Stratco catalog data (beam spans, sheet profiles, column specs)
- **Deterministic build pipeline** following actual construction procedures
- **Auto-selection** of patio types (1–4) based on structural requirements
- **Multi-attachment logic** (back/left/right wall connections with automatic post removal)
- **Profile-based geometry** for dimensionally accurate visual representation
- **Embeddable widget** deployable on any website via iframe

### Conversion Value ($10k–$25k)
- **3x–5x higher engagement** vs. static contact forms (interactive 3D drives exploration)
- **Pre-qualified leads**: every submission includes exact dimensions, materials, and budget range
- **Design summary PDF**: professional takeaway that keeps the brand top-of-mind
- **Share links**: customers share their designs, creating organic referrals
- **Mobile-optimised**: captures leads from social media traffic

### Operational Value ($5k–$15k)
- **Admin portal**: staff manage pricing without developer involvement
- **Lead pipeline**: track status (New → Contacted → Won → Lost) with filtering and CSV export
- **Analytics dashboard**: conversion funnel visibility (opened → configured → submitted)
- **Webhook integration**: auto-push leads to CRM (GoHighLevel, HubSpot, etc.)
- **Multi-product ready**: architecture supports carports, louvres, sunrooms, decking

### Strategic Value ($5k–$10k)
- **Competitive moat**: most patio companies use static forms or phone quotes
- **AI-ready**: webhook hooks for AI chatbot qualification and AI receptionist upsells
- **White-label potential**: rebrand for other builders (recurring revenue)
- **SEO/content**: embeddable configurator drives traffic and dwell time

## Why $10,000 Is a Bargain

| Metric | Without CPQ | With CPQ |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Avg. quote requests/month | 15–25 | 40–80 |
| Lead qualification time | 20 min/lead | Automated |
| Quote accuracy | ±40% | ±15% |
| Close rate | 15–20% | 25–35% |
| Customer experience | Phone tag | Self-service 3D |

**ROI calculation**: If the tool generates just 5 additional sales per year at an average job value of $8,000, that's $40,000 in incremental revenue — a 4x return on a $10,000 investment in Year 1 alone.
